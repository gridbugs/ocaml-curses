Bindings to curses/ncurses
====

Tools for building terminal-based user interfaces.

Overview
---

OCaml Curses is a project to provide curses / ncurses bindings for the
Objective Caml language.

It was formally known as Text Mode Kit (TMK), but the TMK part of the project
is not supported anymore, and instead we are just concentrating on providing
reliable OCaml curses bindings. The author of TMK and the original version of
the bindings was Nicolas George.

OCaml Curses is free software, under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
License.
